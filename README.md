# SSH
A simple, non-interactive Android SSH client.

# Why?
There's plenty of SSH clients out there, but I was never satisfied with the available selection. Some use in-app purchases, some have ads, some have UI's that date back years. Termux was one of the most promising SSH clients available, but I wanted something that felt more natural on a mobile device. It doesn't need to have fancy features, just a simple shell that can let me remotely manage my servers.
